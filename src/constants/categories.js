This allows completely new functions, e.g., the projection of guidelines or warning symbols onto the road ahead. In the MULTIBEAM LED headlamp, a light module with 84 LEDs arranged in three lines creates a grid in the form of a matrix. With this arrangement, not only the light distribution of the high beam but also that of the low beam is freely configurable and technically precise. MULTIBEAM LED therefore allows different light functions to actuate independently. The content was produced pre COVID-19."
